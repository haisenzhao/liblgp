This code is header-only Library developed by Haisen Zhao for his research projects.

# Dependency

Depend on [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm.git) and [eigen](https://github.com/libigl/eigen.git) but you don't need to install them explicitly.

# Usage in Cmake

```

include(ExternalProject)
ExternalProject_Add(
    pgl
    PREFIX ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/third_party/pgl
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/haisenzhao/personal-geom-lib.git
    CONFIGURE_COMMAND ""
	UPDATE_DISCONNECTED 1
    BUILD_COMMAND ""
    INSTALL_COMMAND ""
    LOG_DOWNLOAD ON
    )
ExternalProject_Get_Property(pgl source_dir)
set(PglIncludeDir ${source_dir})
